Ever since childhood, Iâ€™ve wondered why people make the decisions they do, and find it exciting to guess others' emotions, thoughts, or motivations. Furthermore, I've always loved putting myself in someone else's shoes but later realized that itâ€™s a great skill named empathy. That's one of the reasons why UX design is so enjoyable to me.",

After graduating, I became interested in graphic design and worked on freelance projects, which led me to UX Design and took the best courses of Google, Idxf, and DesignLab. Completing those comprehensive courses helped me become a confident UX designer.",

During that time I realized that I wanted the whole package of UX, and wanted to use my other design skills too. That's how I moved to a design agency as a Product Designer.",
