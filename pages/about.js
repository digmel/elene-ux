Ever since childhood, Iâ€™ve wondered why people make the decisions they do, and find it exciting to guess others' emotions, thoughts, or motivations. Furthermore, I've always loved putting myself in someone else's shoes but later realized that itâ€™s a great skill named empathy. That's one of the reasons why UX design is so enjoyable to me.",
